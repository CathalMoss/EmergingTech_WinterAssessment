## Project Brief
This assessment is broken down into 3 components as detailed below:

**1. Github Repository (20%)**
  1. Clear and infomative README.md explaining why the repository exists, what is in it, and how the notebooks work. **(10%)**
   2. A Dockerfile/ docker.compose.yml file that enablels someone to quickly run your notebooks with minimal configuration.  Include required files, e.g, requirements.txt file, data files and image files. **(10%)**
     
**2. Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook (40%)**
   1. A clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library. **(10%)**
   2. Demonstrations of at least 3 interesting sciki-learn algorithms. **(20%)**
   3. Plots and visualisations is needed to enchance your notebook for viewers. **(10%)**   

**3. Quantum Computing Jupyter Notebook (40%)**
   1. A clear and concuse comparison of quantum computing and classical computing. **(15%)**
   2. An explanation of Deutsh's algorithm and code simulating it using qiskit. **(25%)**

## 1. Github Repository
**What is in it?**

In this Github repository I will be going through 2.1) a clear and concise overview of *scikit-learn.ipynb* while also demonstrating 3 algorithms which is a part of *scikit-learn python libarary*.  There will also be plots and visualisations to give the user a better understanding of the algorithms.  Attached is a DockerFile that makes the notebooks easily accessible with minimal configuration.

There is another notebook which is called *quantum-deutsch.iypnb*, in this notebook I will delve into the difference between quantum computing and classical computing.  There will also be an explanation of the *Deutsch's Algorithm* with code simulating it using qiskit.

**How to run the notebook**
1. Download [Anaconda]().
2. Download [cmder]() if on Windows.
3. Run 'jupyter lab'
